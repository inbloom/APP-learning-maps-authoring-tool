# Learning Maps Authoring Tool

## Summary
The Learning Maps Authoring Tool is a GUI that enables users to construct visual learning pathways using learning standards stored in the [Learning Resource Index](http://lri_url/fixme "Learning Resource Index"). In addition to being a useful application in its own right, the LMAT serves as an exemplar application detailing the use of the LRI API. Initial development of the Learning Maps Authoring Tool was sponsored by inBloom, Inc. and is released under the Apache license.
