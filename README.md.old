The jQuery Tree Widget was modified to fit the requirements for the Learning Map Authoring Tool. This included adding
functionality to get all checked elements from a tree as well as getting all checked leaves from a tree. The jQuery
Tree Widget included a patch for a jQuery-UI bug which had already been fixed in a newer version of jQuery-UI so that
patch was commented out. Lastly, multiple lines of code were removed from jquery.tree.js in an attempt to reduce the
effect of a bug which caused the number of HTML elements within a parent element of a tree to grow exponentially with
each child that was added to the parent.
